# Advent of Code 2021
Decided to use Rust on this one. Let's go!!


## File Naming Conventions
Thus far, the challenge for a particular day is divided into two parts. I've therefore decided to name the files as per the day and also the part. 

The files are there named in this format. `day<number><part>`. Day numbers less than 10 are zero-padded. e.g.
`day011.rs` could be read as `day01` for day 1 and `1.rs` being part 1.
